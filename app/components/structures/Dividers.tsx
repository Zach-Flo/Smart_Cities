            Our project delves into E-Scooter usage rates across various Chicago regions, 
            employing machine learning techniques for analysis. Through data-driven insights, 
            we aim to understand patterns and trends in E-Scooter utilization, considering factors 
            like time, weather, and geography. Our findings intend to inform city planners and transportation 
            authorities, aiding in the enhancement of urban mobility and sustainability strategies in Chicago.
